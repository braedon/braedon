Hi, I'm Braedon, a Kiwi software developer. Currently I'm busy building a [privacy focused authentication provider](https://projectalias.com).

When I'm not thinking too much about web privacy, I maintain a few open source services and tools.

### Services
- Need to send a password to a colleague, but don't want it in your chat history? [Use **Shh!** to safely share secrets with expiring, one-time links](https://shh.resisty.com). ([source](https://github.com/braedon/shh))
- Got a link that's down? [**Up?** will notify you when it's back up](https://up.resisty.com). ([source](https://github.com/braedon/up))
